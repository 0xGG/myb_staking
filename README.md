  ```bash
  nvm install lts/erbium # Install nodejs lts v12
  nvm alias default lts/erbium
  ```

* yarn: run `npm install -g yarn` to install the yarn command.  

## Steps

1. Install necessary npm packages

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Run and serve locally

```bash
yarn serve
```

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```
