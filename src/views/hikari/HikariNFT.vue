          <p class="lead">There are premium kitsune and spell cards. These NFTs can be obtained through loot boxes, traded with other players, minted through combining two kitsune cards, or purchased in the Hikari marketplace.

          <h3 class="text-white">Minting</h3>
          <p class="lead">A player can combine 2 existing kitsune cards (base or NFT), to create a new premium kitsune NFT card. This process requires in-game currency, and the two combined cards are burned forever. The newly minted NFT kitsune card will have combined symbols from the original sacrificed cards, and number or number range of the used cards (there is a probability table for how this is resolved).
